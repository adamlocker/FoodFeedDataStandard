# Sampling Data Standard

This repository contains the documentation describing the data standard which should be used for reporting food and feed sampling results for samples taken by Local Authorities and processed by Laboratories.

It currently only describes the data standards, rather than the mechanism for submitting data to the Food Standards Agency.
